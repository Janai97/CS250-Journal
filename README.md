How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?:
To understand user needs and turn them into a program, I first listen to what the user wants and ask questions to be sure I get it right. I then break their needs into smaller tasks. Creating "user stories" helps because it focuses on what the user wants, making sure the features I create fit their needs.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?:
When developing programs, I like to work step by step, improving as I go. Agile methods like having short work periods (sprints) and regular check-ins help me stay on track and adapt to any changes. I want to use Agile more in the future because it allows for quick adjustments and better teamwork.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?:
Being a good team member means communicating well, helping others when needed, and being reliable. It’s important to work together and share ideas to reach the team’s goals.
